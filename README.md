Nightwatch.js QA Automation demo.

Nightwatch.js is an integrated, easy to use End-to-End testing solution for web applications and websites, written in Node.js. It uses the W3C WebDriver API to drive browsers in order to perform commands and assertions on DOM elements.

## Quick Start

This project includes a very basic test suite to demonstrate the basic workflow of using Nightwatch.js for QA SDET automation.

Getting up and running:

```
git clone && cd into this repo
npm install # build/install required packages for local development
npm run test # executes the full test suite
```
